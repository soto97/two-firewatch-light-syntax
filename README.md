# two-firewatch-light  
A double-hue syntax theme for Atom based on the Vim theme developed by github/rakr. I have used [smlombardi's duotone-blue-dark](https://github.com/smlombardi/duotone-blue-dark) as the Atom syntax code template but used the colors from [rakr's vim-two-firewatch](https://github.com/rakr/vim-two-firewatch) color schem for the Vim editor. In particular, I am using rakr's light color scheme, which I really like.
